# Neural-Networks
Implemented perceptron model, hebbian model, multi-layer neural networks and convolutional neural network using Tensorflow and Keras.

This project is part of the Neural Networks coursework. It contains four parts. Each folder consists of code file and its corresponding test file.

Language Used: Python 3.7

Libraries used: Numpy, Tensorflow, Keras

### Task 1
Implementing the perceptron model.

### Task 2
Implementing different learning rules and use them to classify input vectors. Also, practising batch processing.

### Task 3
Creating multilayer neural networks using Tensorflow.

### Task 4
Creating sequential Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN).

To run the test file,
py.test --verbose <test_file>
